# Project Description

This project was developed as part of my study on the flutter framework. I was curious how to develop a mobile app, so I started to study and develop many apps to improve. This project was very short and I didn't have a lot of work, I just used my previous knowledge to build this simple app because my focus was working with the google maps api. I was able to save the data, I asked the user for permission to access the location of the device in addition to also manipulating the API to tag some nearby locations
